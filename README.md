 **Create a Time Series Model by Using Prophet**: Develop a time series forecasting model using Prophet to predict future search traffic patterns.
 
## Summary of Findings

#### Step 1: Set Up the Google Search Data for a Prophet Forecasting Model

- **Data Preparation**: 
  - Reset the index of `df_mercado_trends` to convert the date index to a column.
  - Renamed the columns to 'ds' (date) and 'y' (value) to match Prophet's requirements.
  - Dropped any NaN values from the DataFrame.

- **Model Fitting**:
  - Created and fitted a Prophet model to the prepared DataFrame.
  - Generated future dates for predictions (2000 hours, approximately 80 days).

#### Step 2: Plot the Forecast

- **Forecast Plot**:
  - Plotted the forecasted Google search trends using the Prophet model.
  - Near-term forecast indicates expected patterns and trends in the popularity of MercadoLibre over the next 2000 hours.

#### Step 3: Analyze Time Series Components

- **Components Plot**:
  - Used the `plot_components` function of the Prophet model to analyze the seasonal patterns.
  - Key Findings:
    - **Time of Day**: Greatest popularity around midnight.
    - **Day of the Week**: Highest search traffic on Tuesday.
    - **Lowest Point in the Year**: Around mid-October.

#### Step 4: Forecast Revenue by Using Time Series Models

- **Data Preparation**:
  - Loaded daily historical sales data from `mercado_daily_revenue.csv`.
  - Set the "date" column as the index and converted it to the required format for Prophet.

- **Model Fitting and Forecast**:
  - Created and fitted a Prophet model to the sales data.
  - Generated future dates for predictions (90 days, approximately one quarter).

#### Step 5: Interpret the Revenue Model Output

- **Seasonal Patterns**:
  - Analyzed the seasonal components of the revenue model using the `plot_components` function.
  - Identified peak revenue days as Sundays and Tuesdays.

#### Step 6: Produce a Sales Forecast for the Next Quarter

- **Forecast Visualization**:
  - Plotted the sales forecast for the next quarter.
  - Summarized the forecast data to provide expected total sales.

- **Quarterly Sales Forecast**:
  - **Most Likely Outcome**: $969.61 million USD
  - **Best-Case Scenario**: $1051.19 million USD
  - **Worst-Case Scenario**: $888.02 million USD

### Summary for the Finance Division

Based on the forecast information generated:

- **Next Quarter Sales Forecast**:
  - The total expected sales for the next quarter could reach as high as $1051 million USD or as low as $888 million USD, with the most likely outcome being around $970 million USD. This forecast helps in planning budgets and setting realistic expectations for company investors. 

These findings provide actionable insights for the finance division to make informed decisions about future budgets and investment plans.
